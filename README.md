# Stewart Concrete & Finishing Calendar
>Job calendar that can store construction job informations such as dates and resources. Final project for my Object Oriented Design class (CSCI 5335) which our team experimented the Agile and Scrum software development methodologies as well as many different object oriented programming design patterns.

Job calendar system that manages when and where jobs would be using Microsoft Excel as our backend database. The user is able to add job data such as job name, date, price, resources, and start/end dates. The job is then saved in Excel using the JXL library so that the user does not need to have any database software installed. The user can then allocate resources to jobs after creating the job. This was my first ever project with a real client.

## Usage

To simplify and merge the job management process of Stewart Concrete.
